# TechnoGen: An AI Techno Music Generator

> Author: `Anton Lechuga` <br>
> Project Type: `Bring your own data` <br>
> Domain `Audio Processing`

In this project, I will try to build a model that is able to generate Electronic Dance Music (EDM), mainly the subgeneres of
[Industrial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_techno) &amp; [Acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_techno) Techno.
It is a project for the course 'Applied Deep Learning' at the Technical University Vienna.

## Introduction

## Data

- A collection of owned tracks (MIDI),
  - divided by Beat, or longer
- Often follow certain shape and structures

# Approach

Transformer-based model
Investigate whether such a model is capable of capturing some
of the key concepts in music

- OpenAI's model [Jukebox](https://openai.com/research/jukebox)
- Meta's [AudioCraft](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/08/audiocraft-generative-ai-for-music-and-audio/#:~:text=AudioCraft%20consists%20of%20three%20models,generates%20audio%20from%20text%20prompts.) with some interesting [articles](https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/2/23816431/meta-generative-ai-music-audio)  already written about it

# TODO for A1

1. References to at least two scientific papers that are related to your topic
2. A decision of a topic of your choice (see below for inspiration)
3. A decision of which type of project you want to do (see below)
4. A written summary that should contain:
    1. Short description of your project idea and the approach you intend to use
    2. Description of the dataset you are about to use (or collect)
    3. A work-breakdown structure for the individual tasks with time estimates (hours or days) for dataset collection; designing and building an appropriate network; training and fine-tuning that network; building an application to present the results; writing the final report; preparing the presentation of your work.

# Ideas

- Use Transformer Models
  - Predict next bars/beats
  - Next Beat, Bar generation
  - Get Model to find concepts such as key, major/minor, etc. [Google](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/music-transformer) has implemented a first transformer model and there are other interesting [articles](https://www.rootstrap.com/blog/how-to-generate-music-with-ai) writing about it

## Time Plan

Following, we present the time plan for the project: WOY (Week of Year), Days (full work days) and respective task.

| Task | Days | DeadlineÂ |
